# Matrix-Generator-
This is a 2 problem lab that uses threads to solve.
The process should be begun on the command line of a linux OS and will require a number as a command line argument to be the size of the matrix generated later in the problem. 
The first problem consists of a matrix of any positive n size, populated with 0's and 1's.
The goal of the problem is to get all the indices in the matrix to turn to either ones or 0's by looking at a randomly generated indices neighbors.
There are however, cases in large matrices where the numbers will generate infinitely because there can be no solvable cases. 
If the point generated can have 8,5,or 3 neighbors and it will take the values between them and change its value whatever has a greater population in the neighborhood, the zeros or the ones.  
The second problem is a sorting algorithm and generated a 1d array of n size and then sorts it returning the threads running the processes.
